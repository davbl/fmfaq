                <h2>🍏What is fructose?</h2>
                <p>Fructose is a naturally occurring simple sugar. You can find it in fruit, hence the name fructose, vegetables, or honey. Fructose also makes up 50% of table sugar, sucrose, the other half being another simple sugar, glucose.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>🧨What is fructose malabsorption?</h2>
                <p>FM occurs when your body <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose_malabsorption" target="_blank">isn't able to absorb fructose</a> in the small intestine and send it to the liver. Instead, fructose stays in the gut where it is not supposed to be and gets fermented by your gut microbiota. That disrupts the normal digestive process.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>💩What are the symptoms?</h2>
                <p>Diarrhea or at least loose stools, gas, bloating, chronic fatigue, nutritional deficiencies, possibly depression.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>🔬How do I get tested?</h2>
                <p>With a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_breath_test" target="_blank">hydrogen breath test</a>. Procedure: Arrive on empty stomach, brush teeth at doctor's office, drink fructose solution, breath every 15 minutes into a plastic bag for 4 hours, discuss results. It is normal if SIBO, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestinal_bacterial_overgrowth" target="_blank">small intestinal bacterial overgrowth</a>, is found along with FM.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>🩹What's the treatment?</h2>
                <p>As of 2020, there is no cure but it can be managed by strictly following a low- or no-fructose diet, and taking a xylose isomerase enzyme before a meal containing fructose. Brand names for xylose isomerase are <a href="https://amzn.to/2VSVG8y" target="_blank">Fructaid</a> and <a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&pub=5575585655&toolid=10001&campid=5338680335&customid=&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FLutomerase-108-capsules-Fructose-intolerance-malabsorption-Xylose-Isomerase%2F252926486520" target="_blank">Lutomerase</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>🥄What can I eat?</h2>
                <p>One of the best strategies, besides seeing a specialist, is to get a mobile app with a database of foods and their fructose content. For instance <a href="https://www.baliza.de/en/apps/histamine.html" target="_blank">Food Intolerances</a> or <a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/ibs-central/i-have-ibs/get-the-app/" target="_blank">Monash University FODMAP Diet</a>. A lesser known option that is safe is to get nutritionally complete powder food. For example Super Body Fuel (except for strawberry flavor). For <a href="https://www.blendrunner.com/" target="_blank">other brands</a>, be sure to check their list of ingredients.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>🧅Anything else to avoid besides fructose?</h2>
                <p>Yes, the general advice is to minimize or eliminate fructans and polyols. However, test the degree of your personal sensitivity. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructan" target="_blank">Fructans</a> are chains of fructose molecules and are mainly found in garlic, onion, and wheat. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyol" target="_blank">Polyols</a> are sugar alcohols and include sorbitol, maltitol, xylitol, erythritol, isomalt.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>🍪Can I eat sweet things?</h2>
                <p>Yes, but only those sweetened with glucose = dextrose, lactose, monk fruit extract, not with fructose, sucrose = table sugar, honey, high fructose corn syrup.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>🧑‍⚕️Will my family doctor be familiar with this disorder?</h2>
                <p>Unlikely, unfortunately. It seems FM is still quite unknown among physicians. However, your experience may vary.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>🧬Is it genetic?</h2>
                <p>There is anecdotal evidence fructose malabsorption runs in families, often undiagnosed. However, the origin of FM remains unresolved.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>🧐Is fructose malabsorption fructose intolerance?</h2>
                <p>Fructose intolerance usually refers to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_fructose_intolerance" target="_blank">Hereditary fructose intolerance</a>, which is a separate condition from fructose malabsorption. HFI is caused by mutations in the gene that codes for the enzyme aldolase B. This enzyme metabolizes fructose in the liver rather than in the small intestine.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>⌨️Are there any online communities?</h2>
                <p>Yes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fructosemalabsorption/" target="_blank">r/fructosemalabsorption</a> on Reddit, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/fructosemalabsorptionusa/" target="_blank">Fructose Malabsorption USA</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FMSGVIC/" target="_blank">Fructose Malabsorption Victoria</a> on Facebook. If you join, be a good person, but use critical thinking and watch out for misinformation. Trust but verify.</p>

            <h2>About the Author</h2>
            <p>Inspired by the millionth fructose-induced diarrhea, David changed his major to molecular biology during graduate school. Now he is studying absorption and metabolism of fructose to identify the gene or genes that may be responsible for the development of fructose malabsorption.</p>
